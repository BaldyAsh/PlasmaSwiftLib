## Features

- [x] Based on [More Viable Plasma Implementation](https://github.com/matterinc/PlasmaContract) by The Matter Team
- [x] RLP encoding and decoding
- [x] Comprehensive Unit and Integration Test Coverage
- [x] [Complete Documentation](https://matterinc.github.io/PlasmaSwiftLib)

## Design Decisions

- Functionality was focused on serializing and signing transactions locally on the device
- Sending raw transactions to The Matter Plasma network using REST API
- Sending raw transactions to Plasma Contract using [The Matter web3swift](https://github.com/matterinc/web3swift)

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate PlasmaSwiftLib into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'PlasmaSwiftLib', '~> 1.0.7'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PlasmaSwiftLib into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "matterinc/PlasmaSwiftLib" "carthage"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `web3swift.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Transaction structure

The transaction structure, that is used in The Matter Plasma Implementation is the UTXO model with explicit enumeration of UTXOs in the inputs.

### Input
An RLP encoded set with the following items:
- Block number, 4 bytes
- Transaction number in block, 4 bytes
- Output number in transaction, 1 byte
- "Amount" field, 32 bytes, that is more a data field, usually used for an amount of the output referenced by previous field, but has special meaning for "Deposit" transactions

### Output
An RLP encoded set with the following items:
- Output number in transaction, 1 byte
- Receiver's Ethereum address, 20 bytes
- "Amount" field, 32 bytes

### Transaction 
An RLP encoded set with the following items:
- Transaction type, 1 byte
- An array (list) of Inputs, maximum 2 items
- An array (list) of Outputs, maximum 3 items. One of the outputs is an explicit output to an address of Plasma operator.

### Signed transaction 
An RLP encoded set with the following items:
- Transaction, as described above
- Recoverable EC of the transaction sender:
   1) V value, 1 byte, expected values 27, 28
   2) R value, 32 bytes
   3) S value, 32 bytes

From this signature Plasma operator deduces a sender, checks that the sender is an owner of UTXOs referenced by inputs. Signature is based on EthereumPersonalHash(RLPEncode(Transaction)). Transaction should be well-formed, sum of inputs equal to sum of the outputs, etc.

## Block structure

### Block header
- Block number, 4 bytes, used in the main chain to double check proper ordering
- Number of transactions in block, 4 bytes, purely informational
- Parent hash, 32 bytes, hash of the previous block, hashes the full header
- Merkle root of the transactions tree, 32 bytes
- V value, 1 byte, expected values 27, 28
- R value, 32 bytes
- S value, 32 bytes

Signature is based on EthereumPersonalHash(block number || number of transactions || previous hash || merkle root), where || means concatenation. Values V, R, S are then concatenated to the header.

### Block
- Block header, as described above, 137 bytes
- RLP encoded array (list) of signed transactions, as described above

While some fields can be excessive, such block header can be submitted by anyone to the main Ethereum chain when block is available, but for some reason not sent to the smart contract. Transaction numbering is done by the operator, it should be monotonically increasing without spaces and number of transactions in header should (although this is not necessary for the functionality) match the number of transactions in the Merkle tree and the full block.

## Example Project

## Donations

[The Matters](https://github.com/orgs/matterinc/people) are charged with open-sor—Åe and do not require money for using their PlasmaSwiftLib.
We want to continue to do everything we can to move the needle forward.
If you use any of our libraries for work, see if your employers would be interested in donating. Any amount you can donate today to help us reach our goal would be greatly appreciated.
